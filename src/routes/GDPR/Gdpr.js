            </p>
            <p style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}><b>How the company uses your personal data?</b></p>
            <p>We routinely use your personal data only for purposes related to the platform ImpactN. These are the following purposes:<br /></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Registering you as a user.</li>
                <li>Contacting you about ImpactN activities and updates or actions on topics and projects you have actively shown interest in by liking or commenting.</li>
                <li>Matchmaking with other users according to your declared interests.</li>
                <li>Meeting our legal obligations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The lawful basis for this processing is granting the services you have chosen to use by registering on the platform. 
                We may also use legitimate interest as our lawful basis for the following data processing: <br /></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Processing funding and deducting fees.</li>
                    <li>Confirming your identity when you contact us.</li>
                    <li>Sending you statutory communications (these are communications that, as a company, we have to send you by law).</li>
                    <li>Sending you individualised information according to your indicated interest.</li>
                    <li>Administering rewards distribution as far as it is not regulated by rule-based software which is essentially outside our sphere of influence.</li>
                </ul>
            <p style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}><b>Accessing your personal data within the company?</b></p>
            <p>Some of your personal data will be available to employees of the company and others formally instructed by the company for the purposes of providing and enhancing ImpactN-services.
The type of personal data shared will be relevant to the purpose for which the data is used.</p>
            <p style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}><b>Data security</b></p>
            <p>The company uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information within ImpactN, such as firewalls and SSL (secure socket layers). We make every effort to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. However, data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.</p>
            <p style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}><b>Sharing your personal data with third parties</b></p>
            <p>Data you publish through project posts or comments are public and may be accessed by anybody since we use a public database – the steem blockchain - for this. The same applies to transfer of blockchain currency and the amount you hold in your wallet.
Blockchain accounts normally are pseudonymous meaning the account is not related to a single person, which is not identifiable. By publishing personal data on the blockchain this pseudonymity is removed and you become identifiable and share your personal data with third parties.
<br />Apart from this process controlled by the user himself, we share your information with third parties such as:<br />
</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mailing and template software providers</li>
                <li>Cloud service providers</li>
                <li>External workforce</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When we share your data, we only share the minimum required for the purpose of the data processing. We also ensure that processes are in place so that data is always transferred to third parties securely.
The third parties we share data with are:
For all ImpactN users:
</p>
            <ul>
                <li>heroku – the company providing a cloud-based service for developing and running applications</li>
                <li>oracle-d – the organisation providing the widget to register a blockchain account</li>
                <li>mailchimp – the organisation running the software for mailing</li>
            </ul>
            <p style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}><b>Market research</b></p>
<p>You may be contacted and invited to participate in market research activities by third party organisations acting on the companies behalf. 
    While such research helps us to get valuable feedback on how we work well and where we can get better – and as such your participation is very 
    helpful and always appreciated – you are not obliged to participate in such research. If you don’t want to, simply let the researcher know.</p>
    <p style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}><b>Retention of data</b></p>
